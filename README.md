## About Us
Gamer Ammo is on a mission of declaration: _Gaming is a Profession_. We are declaring this a fact by building a suite of gaming related software aimed at making the gamer's environment more accessibly to profiting from their profession. This website is the homepage for our flagship product [Clutchat](https://github.com/gamerammo/clutchat), the gamer's hub for chat, content, and finance. We are making this possible by utilizing decentralized peer-to-peer technologies and building the platform gamer-first.

### Decentralized Gaming
When we say we use decentralized technologies, that means we are utilizing the cutting edge of user data management in-order to provide our services to you. We utilized distributed ledger technology, some written by us or others, to provide the gamer the content and the information they say. This provides anonymity, security, and allows us room for innovation. In the event of blockchain technologies, we utilize the [Ethereum Classic](https://github.com/ethereumproject) network.
